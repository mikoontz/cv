I am a co-equal parent to a child that was 4 months old in March of 2020, when the first stay-at-home orders were implemented in our community.
My spouse (who also works full time) and I didn't have any childcare support until March of 2021, and didn't have full-time childcare support until 2022.
Juggling childcare and professional responsiblities required that I disengage from a number of teaching and research opportunities between 2020 and 2022.
